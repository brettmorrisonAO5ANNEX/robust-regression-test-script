## Overview
This was a test implementation of robust regression using Huber Loss created with ChatGPT. I plan to integrate this into a C# project I'm working on via IronPython...

## Update
I think instead of trying to integrate python scripts in my .NET project via IronPython I'm just gonna try to translate this script over to C#... hopefully it works out!
